# What I want you to work on from here to Sunday is learn how to create basic data structures in Python. 
# I want you to use classes, and start with the following:

# 1) A class called IntNode, which holds an int value and a pointer to another IntNode.

# 2) A class called IntList, which has two pointers to IntNodes, one called head, 
# and another one called tail. Also, I want IntList to have the following methods:
# Size(), which returns an int with the amount of nodes in the list.
# Insert(int value) which inserts the value at the end of the list.
# Contains(int value) which returns true or false depending on whether the value is contained in the list or not.
# Delete(int position) which deletes the value at the specified position.
# Get(int position) which returns the int value at the specified position.
# 3) Finally, a small program that inserts values 5,3,6 and 5 into your list, 
# and then iterates with a loop to extract the values and print them on screen.

# After you're done with this, let me know and send me a link to the python file(s) 
# in GitHub so I can take a look and then we can talk about small algorithms and more complex data structures to play with.
